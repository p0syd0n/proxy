# proxy
simple python proxy

uses urllib module

To use, start program, then go to web browser, and type:
```
localhost:9097/WEBSITENAME
```
replace WEBSITENAME to the site you would like to visit. This works to get around routers with reastrictions, whether at school, home, or work.

it will show a bunch of errors but it works- I am working on fixing those.
